# Computer Security Glossary of Terms

#### Access authorization 

Restricts access to a computer to a group of users through the use of authentication systems. These systems can protect either the whole computer, such as through an interactive login screen, or individual services, such as a FTP server. There are many methods for identifying and authenticating users, such as passwords, identification cards, smart cards, and biometric systems.

#### Anti-virus software

Computer programs that attempt to identify, thwart, and eliminate computer viruses and other malicious software (malware).

#### Authentication
Techniques can be used to ensure that communication end-points are who they say they are.

#### Cyberbullying
The use of electronic communication to bully a person, typically by sending messages of an intimidating or threatening nature.

#### Cryptography

#### Encryption

Software used to protect the confidentiality of a message. Cryptographically secure ciphers are designed to make any practical attempt of breaking them infeasible. Symmetric-key ciphers are suitable for bulk encryption using shared keys, and public-key encryption using digital certificates can provide a practical solution for the problem of securely communicating when no key is shared in advance.

#### Ethical Hacking

Rules of Engagement

#### Firewall

 Gatekeeper systems between networks that only allows traffic that matches defined rules.
 
 Firewalls often include detailed logging, and may include intrusion detection and intrusion prevention features. They are near-universal between company local area networks and the Internet, but can also be used internally to impose traffic rules between networks if network segmentation is configured.

#### Keyloggers

#### Hacking

#### Hijacking

#### Home Network Security

#### Honey pots
Computers that are intentionally left vulnerable to attack by crackers. They can be used to catch crackers and to identify their techniques.

#### Identity Theft

#### Intrusion-detection system

Devices or software applications that monitor networks or systems for malicious activity or policy violations.

#### Malware

#### Passwords

#### Port scan
A probe an IP address for open ports to identify accessible network services and applications.

#### Phishing

#### Pharming

#### Privacy Settings

#### Ransomware

#### ROT-13

#### SSL - Secure Sockets Layer

#### Spyware

#### SPAM

#### Two Factor Authentication

#### Trojans

#### Viruses

#### WiFi Security

#### Worms

#### zero-day Exploit

A computer-software vulnerability either unknown to those who should be interested in its mitigation or known and without a patch to correct it.

Until the vulnerability is mitigated, hackers can exploit it to adversely affect programs, data, additional computers or a network.

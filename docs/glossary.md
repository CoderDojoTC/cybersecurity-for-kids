# Computer Security Glossary of Terms

#### Access authorization 

Restricts access to a computer to a group of users through the use of authentication systems. These systems can protect either the whole computer, such as through an interactive login screen, or individual services, such as a FTP server. There are many methods for identifying and authenticating users, such as passwords, identification cards, smart cards, and biometric systems.

#### Anti-virus software

Computer programs that attempt to identify, thwart, and eliminate computer viruses and other malicious software (malware).

#### Authentication
Techniques can be used to ensure that communication end-points are who they say they are.

#### Cyberbullying
The use of electronic communication to bully a person, typically by sending messages of an intimidating or threatening nature.

#### Cryptography

#### Encryption

Software used to protect the confidentiality of a message. Cryptographically secure ciphers are designed to make any practical attempt of breaking them infeasible. Symmetric-key ciphers are suitable for bulk encryption using shared keys, and public-key encryption using digital certificates can provide a practical solution for the problem of securely communicating when no key is shared in advance.

#### Ethical Hacking  

Using the actions of criminals to gain unauthorized access to computer systems, applicaitons or data while having persmission to perform an authorized attempt.The main goal is to discover vulnerabilities that can be exploited, demonstrate how the access was gained and provide detailed instruction on how to fix the vulnerabilities. Every ethical hacking attempt has rules of engagement, which defines how an ethical hack would be laid out, what methodology will be used, the start and end dates, the milestones, the goals of the penetration test, the liabilities and responsibilities. 


#### Firewall

Gatekeeper systems between networks that only allows traffic that matches defined rules.
 
Firewalls often include detailed logging, and may include intrusion detection and intrusion prevention features. They are near-universal between company local area networks and the Internet, but can also be used internally to impose traffic rules between networks if network segmentation is configured.

#### Keyloggers  

Malicious forms of software and hardware that can detect the input from a computer's keyboard and save it for retrieval later or send it to a server connected over the internet to steal data from the victim's computer. Used to steal sensitive information such as logins, passwords, credit cards and other forms of protected data. 


#### Hacking  

An individual with technical computer skills but often refers to individuals who use their skills to breach cybersecurity defenses.  
The term is often used inappropriately to refer to criminals who use these skills to perform illegal acts of computer theft. 

#### Hijacking  
A network security attack where the attacker takes control of computer systems, software and / or network communications.  


#### Home Network Security

#### Honey pots
Computers that are intentionally left vulnerable to attack by crackers. They can be used to catch crackers and to identify their techniques.

#### Identity Theft

#### Intrusion-detection system

Devices or software applications that monitor networks or systems for malicious activity or policy violations.

#### Malware

#### Passwords

#### Port scan
A probe an IP address for open ports to identify accessible network services and applications.

#### Phishing

#### Pharming

#### Privacy Settings

#### Ransomware

#### ROT-13

#### SSL - Secure Sockets Layer

#### Spyware

#### SPAM

#### Two Factor Authentication

#### Trojans

#### Viruses

#### WiFi Security

#### Worms

#### zero-day Exploit

A computer-software vulnerability either unknown to those who should be interested in its mitigation or known and without a patch to correct it.

Until the vulnerability is mitigated, hackers can exploit it to adversely affect programs, data, additional computers or a network.

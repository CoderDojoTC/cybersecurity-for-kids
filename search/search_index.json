These systems can protect either the whole computer, such as through an interactive login screen, or individual services, such as a FTP server. There are many methods for identifying and authenticating users, such as passwords, identification cards, smart cards, and biometric systems. Anti-virus software Computer programs that attempt to identify, thwart, and eliminate computer viruses and other malicious software (malware). Authentication Techniques can be used to ensure that communication end-points are who they say they are. Cyberbullying The use of electronic communication to bully a person, typically by sending messages of an intimidating or threatening nature. Wikipedia Page on Cyberbullying Cryptography Encryption Software used to protect the confidentiality of a message. Cryptographically secure ciphers are designed to make any practical attempt of breaking them infeasible. Symmetric-key ciphers are suitable for bulk encryption using shared keys, and public-key encryption using digital certificates can provide a practical solution for the problem of securely communicating when no key is shared in advance. Ethical Hacking Rules of Engagement Firewall Gatekeeper systems between networks that only allows traffic that matches defined rules. Firewalls often include detailed logging, and may include intrusion detection and intrusion prevention features. They are near-universal between company local area networks and the Internet, but can also be used internally to impose traffic rules between networks if network segmentation is configured. Keyloggers Hacking Hijacking Home Network Security Honey pots Computers that are intentionally left vulnerable to attack by crackers. They can be used to catch crackers and to identify their techniques. Identity Theft Intrusion-detection system Devices or software applications that monitor networks or systems for malicious activity or policy violations. Malware Passwords Port scan A probe an IP address for open ports to identify accessible network services and applications. Phishing Pharming Privacy Settings Ransomware ROT-13 SSL - Secure Sockets Layer Spyware SPAM Two Factor Authentication Trojans Viruses WiFi Security Worms zero-day Exploit A computer-software vulnerability either unknown to those who should be interested in its mitigation or known and without a patch to correct it. Until the vulnerability is mitigated, hackers can exploit it to adversely affect programs, data, additional computers or a network.","title":"Glossary"},{"location":"glossary/#computer-security-glossary-of-terms","text":"","title":"Computer Security Glossary of Terms"},{"location":"glossary/#access-authorization","text":"Restricts access to a computer to a group of users through the use of authentication systems.
